# kovasir

I was exploring intermediate representations with Kovas Boguta, hence "Kovas
IR". After an initial experiment together, I went off and explored lots of
other stuff on my own using that base. Now, the name of this repo sounds like
what Kitchen Table Coders should name their own brand of cognac.

Once the dust settles on my various experiments, I might write something
interesting here (or elsewhere, or nowhere).
